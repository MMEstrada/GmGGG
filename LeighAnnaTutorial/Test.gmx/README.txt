So, here is the folder for anything Leigh-anna Griswould has worked on but is not implemented in the game for whatever reason. 

Currently, I have worked on:
Regular Orderlies (OBJ_Enemy)
Brute Orderlies (OBJ_EnemyBrute)
Intern Orderlies (OBJ_Intern)

Things to note:
--Brute Orderly does look a bit weird but that SHOULD be just a sprite thing. Once we have the correct sprites, the code (once converted) should work.

--Intern is like 65% done. It still runs outside of the boundries of the Battle Region and it doesn't move while attacking correctly. It sometimes moves after attacking, sometimes doesn't... 

Anything else should be just a quick change in variables, but if not, let me know on Slack! :3
